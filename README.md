Port of WiggleWizard's Quake3 Unity3D code to Godot

You can find WiggleWizard's original code here:
https://github.com/WiggleWizard/quake3-movement-unity3d

You can find a video of him using it here:

The port was done for me by dead_lucky_32 on Fiverr:

It doesn't feel exactly like Quake3 yet, but it is a great starting point for further tweaks.
Pull requests are very welcome.
